# Poverty_Level_Calculator
Python GUI app to calculate household poverty status using U.S Federal Guidelines

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
I developed a Poverty Level Calculator in Python to estimate the poverty status of U.S. households based on household size, monthly income, and location. 
In the United States, the poverty threshold varies depending on the size of the household and its geographic location. 
For the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, the poverty thresholds are the same, while Alaska and Hawaii have different thresholds. These thresholds, ranging from household sizes 1 to 8, are detailed in #Source: https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines
For households larger than eight members, an additional amount is added for each extra person.

The poverty levels are categorized based on the percentage of the official poverty threshold, following the definitions:

*Extreme Poverty: Income below 50% of the official poverty threshold

*Poverty: Income below 100% of the official poverty threshold

*Near Poverty (Vulnerable): Income below 150% of the official poverty threshold

*Low Income but Not in Poverty: Income between 150% and 200% of the poverty threshold

*Moderate or High Income: Income above 200% of the poverty threshold

This calculator helps visualize and classify household income levels relative to federal poverty guidelines, incorporating location-specific thresholds to increase accuracy.
